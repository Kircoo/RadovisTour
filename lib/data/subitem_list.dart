    description:
        '''Plachkovica is medium-high mountain in the eastern part of Macedonia. The highest point is the peak Lisec with a height of 1,754 m.
It rises between the town of Radovish and the Strumica-Radovish Valley to the south and the Kocani Valley to the north, in a northwest-southeast direction.
There are several legends about the origin of the name of the mountain Plachkovica.There are two versions of the first legend which tells the story of Alexander III of Macedon and Philip II of Macedon.
According to the first version, King Alexander III of Macedon resided with a king of Paeonia. The two kings met in the Holy City, which was located on the plateau of Mount Plachkovica. In that Holy City, Alexander and his host Lipius discussed how to maintain good relations between the two nations for better or for worse.
They agreed to help each other in all matters related to state relations. After such an agreement and understanding, there was no end to the joy, and it spread to the people, so that individuals, like the king, began to weep and shed tears of joy.
On the basis of this incident (and because many tears were shed) a stream was formed - a river, which the locals then called Plachkovica, after which they changed the name of the mountain in Plachkovica, names that remain to this day.
According to the second version, the name of that mountain was changed after the meeting of King Alexander III of Macedon and the King of Paeonia - Langar. The meeting of the two kings was on the mountain in the settlement of Svet Grad.
On it, Alexander as Macedonian king, and Langar as king of the Paionians, agreed to establish better state relations than those between his father Philip II while King Langar was alive.
The understanding of state affairs among the kings was at an enviable level, after which the two began to shed tears of joy, so many tears that a stream was formed, which the locals called Plachkovica, because the kings cried with joy.
According to the second legend, King Philip II took his son Alexander to the mountain Plachkovica, which previously had another name, to a woman who knew how to heal to cure him of the excessive crying that overwhelmed him. That woman lived in the town of Plachkovica which was called Svet Grad.
After they brought Prince Alexander accompanied by his father King Philip II and told the woman what it was all about, she replied that the child was completely healthy and was crying because he had too much energy and thus had to frees her, telling them not to get excited, they should leave him alone and that soon, as soon as he starts walking, he will stop crying and predict that he will become a great king and surpass his fathers fame.
When Philip II heard this, who was accompanied by the local king Lipij, who was staying in the Holy City of Plachkovica, he cried with joy like his host, and after their crying, the name of the mountain was changed to Plachkovica.
The length of the main mountain ridge is 34 km. With the valley of Zrnovska Reka, the mountain Plachkovica is divided into two parts: east and west. The western part is lower with the highest peak Turtel (1,689 m), and the eastern part of Plachkovica is higher and it has the peaks Lisec (1,754 m), Cupino (1,725 ​​m), Bel Kamen (1,707 m), Kara Tepe (1,625 m) and others.
The geological composition consists of granites (in the east), crystalline shales, gneisses and a narrow strip of marble in the west. The relief is interesting, represented by fluvial plains (surfaces) in the higher parts and steep mountain sides of a fault character.
The climate of the area from Plachkovica is temperate-continental, with a certain influence of the Mediterranean climate from the south. Average annual temperatures are around 10-12 degrees Celsius. Precipitation is modest and averages about 500 mm per year in the lower to 800 mm in the higher parts.
On the mountain Plachkovica there are three beautiful canyons: Kamnik, Kozjak and Zrnovka in which there are beautiful natural beauties such as rivers, waterfalls, overpasses, high rocks ...
For many, Kamnik Canyon is a small Colorado with its beauty. All canyons are provided with the necessary infrastructure for smooth movement (markings, billboards, signposts, cables, ferries and a place to rest).
Among the many beauties that Mount Plachkovica offers are the caves that there are more, five of which have been explored and are available for visitors. The largest of them is the Great Cave, with a examined length of 600 meters.
It is a real pearl with its cave decorations and a challenge for speleologists. The caves: Zup, Ajduchka, Turtel and Ponor are smaller, but rich in cave decorations and are easily accessible to visitors and lead to marked paths.
The first Macedonian astronomical observatory, in which professionals will work 24 hours, will be located in Plachkovica. In the heart of the mountain, near the famous children's resort managed by the state university Goce Delchev from Stip, the location of the investment worth two million is planned.''',

The Macedonian revolutionary Gjorce Petrov in his book Materials after the study of Macedonia from 1896, wrote about the peak Cupino that it is the main peak of Plachkovica, which rises south of the village Blatec and Vinica in the highest part of the chain, namely where it carries the name Plachkovica.
Above here, the wide ridge of the chain rises like a bare rocky and not particularly high ridge, which can be seen from all over Kocani.
The local population and the older literature call the peak only Cupino, while in the newer military and cadastral topographic maps the peak is found under the name Cupino Brdo, similar to the eponymous peak and branch of the mountain Bilino in northeastern Macedonia.
According to the legend of the locals from Blatec and the villages and Vinica, the name of the peak Chupino came after an incident when the local bey wanted to grab and take in the palace a very beautiful girl Chupa from Blatec, who at that time was mostly inhabited by Turkish population.
The beautiful Chupa, not wanting to be kidnapped and taken to the Saraj, fled to the forests of the mountain Plachkovica where she hid from the Turkish chase for several days. Hiding for several days through the forests, she reached the very top of the rocky area, where she died (from hunger or fatigue) due to which the local population in her honor called the peak and the whole area around Chupino.''',

Administratively, the lake is located entirely in the Municipality of Konce.
Lake Mantovo was built on the river Kriva Lakavica in 1978, with the basic function to irrigate Radovish, to provide water for the needs of the mine Buchim, to provide water supply to the Municipality of Konce, as well as to become the main tourist center in the region.
The lake stretches east to west. It is bordered on the north by the area of the village Dolna Vrastica, on the east by the area of the village Gabrevci, on the south by the area of the village Dolni Radesh, while on the west by the area of the village Garvan, where the embankment of the dam is located.
The lake is rich in rich and diverse species, with many species of freshwater fish and birds in and around it. The most common types of fish are: carp, catfish, carash, perch, chub, scarecrow, scorpionfish, redfish and lichen.
The following species are also found in the reservoir: frogs, sea turtles and water snakes.
Recently, several activities have been undertaken to promote Mantovo as a major tourist center in the region. The pleasant climate with a water temperature of 24 ° C in the summer is suitable for bathing and practicing water sports.
The presence of many species of fish create good preconditions for sport fishing, and the elongated vertical gram rocks near the hill Gabrovska Chuka provide good conditions for alpine climbing.
In December 2014, three wooden Vlach huts were built by the lake as part of a project to promote Vlach cultural heritage in the Ser and Konce regions as part of cross-border co-operation with Greece.
Despite the fact that Vlachs do not live in the Municipality of Konce, the local self-government called the constructed buildings "Vlach huts" because of the place where they passed and stayed.
The cottages are built in an old style, made of wood, with a concrete base, and are equipped with a bed, table and wooden benches.''',

ie it was "scattered by hornbeam", ie. gabbro forest, according to which it bears the name Gabrevci and moved again to the locality Selishte

but both give some assumptions about the origin of the village and the name Oraovica.
According to the first legend, it is assumed that the village got its name from the locality "Orli-Kamen" which is located northeast of the village at a distance of 1 km.
There was a big (high) stone here where the eagles stopped and gathered, so after the locality "Orli-Kamen" it got the name "Orlivici", "Orlovica" and in the end it got the current name Oraovica.
Today's village Oraovica, according to some remains and knowledge, is presumed to have existed before the arrival of the Turks in the Balkans, ie before the XV century.
The village at that time was sparsely populated with Macedonian population. From that period the families meet: Nushovi, Petrushovi, Najchovci, Cilevi, Aleksovi and others.
Oraovica is not in good economic condition. There are many colonial shops in the village, several supermarkets, but still the economic picture of Oraovica is not the best,
which contributed to the fact that the majority of the population in Oraovica is engaged in agriculture and a small part in livestock.
Also, in Oraovica, there is a company that performs partial processing of forest fruits and medicinal herbs.
The company cooperates with many foreign companies, with which the company makes its own personal profit, in which many employees also see their existence.
