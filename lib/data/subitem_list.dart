    description:
        '''In Islamic architecture, a turbe or tulbe is a tombstone, a mausoleum. As such, the turbe has no foundation in the Islamic tradition itself, but under the influence of external factors it has emerged among the Muslims themselves, primarily the Turks.
It became especially popular in the tradition of the Sufis themselves, ie the Muslim ascetics (esotericists). The Seljuks, who acted to change the individual Persian elements, had a decisive influence on the appearance of the turbe today.
There is only one Turbe in Radovish that dates from the ottoman empire with a mosque near the Turbe. You should visit this wonderfull building.''',
