        '''The town of Radovish was mentioned for the first time in 1019 during the reign of the Byzantine King Basil II (which was the name of the town during the Middle Ages. At this time in history, Radovish is an important center for regional trade, craftsmanship and mining.
At that time, the town was located in the North-West of the town's present location, on the banks of the Old river, where we can find traces of several churches, for example St. Archangel church.
In the 14th century, after the withdrawal of the Byzantine Empire, Radovish found itself in the Serb medieval state. In 1361, the tsar Uroš sojourned in Radovish. During the Ottoman Empire, in the 17th Century under the Kyustendil sanjak, it belonged to the diocese of the Kustendil metropolitan.
At that time, the town had 3,000–4,000 inhabitants.
The Medieval period of Radovish is characterized by the expansion and development of Radovish and its surroundings. The economical, political and educational histories of the region can attest to this. In the territory of the Municipality of Radovish are located both explored and unexplored archeological sites, monasteries, and churches all of which are truly a part of a rich heritage of culture monuments. In addition, this territory dates back to prehistoric times and contain artifacts from the Neolithic, Eneolithic, Halsta and the Bronze Ages.
In the time of Philip the Second and Alexander the Great, poems about the territory of the Municipality of Radovish were written. Also, numerous remains date back to Roman times and even earlier. Additional findings include ancient settlements, terms and aqueducts.
During the 19th and 20th centuries Radovish and surrounding regions, were influenced by the historical events related to the Razlovo, Kresnensko and Ilinden Uprisings along with the events related to the Balkans, First and Second World War influenced the entire micro region. During Turkish hegemony in Macedonia in the 16th century, the micro region was populated by a nomadic Turkish population called the Juruci, an ethnic group that still exists to this day in this part of the world.
The documents Kustendilski metropolitan from the 17th century are also called "Radovish documents".
By the end of the 18th century Radovish was a town surrounded by the old fortress, the remains of which also exist today. The former main road to Strumica from Pomoravje through Kumanovo, Ovce Pole and Radovishko Pole led to Thessaloniki and the Orphan Bay''',

        '''Almost one millennium ago, Radovish queen (a princess of Slavic origin) Rada, was looking from the wall of the fortress (the old castle) when she became upset by her fiancée's exclamation "Rado Vish" (Rada look!).
This exclamation that was supposed to warn her of the enemy attack, became according to the legend the name of the city, a synonym of its endurance over the centuries to come.
Another opinion is that the name of the town is from a Vlach name, Radu. Several Slavic names were formed using this name: Radovishte, Radovan, Rađenović, Radulović,etc.
The Turkish name for the town is Radovish, relevant during Ottoman rule. The Serbo-Croat name (used 1913-1943) is Radovishte.''',
